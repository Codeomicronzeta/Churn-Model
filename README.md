1. `Churn Model.ipynb` is a Jupyter Notebook consisting of:<br>
  a. Exploratory Data Analysis of Churn Dataset.<br>
  b. Method for dealing with imbalance in the dataset.<br>
  c. Creating and testing Models for Churn Prediction.<br>

2. `Churn Model.pdf` and `Churn Model.html` are pdf and html files respectively of `Churn Model.ipynb` jupyter notebook for proper viewing and displaying of plots created using Plotly.<br>

3. `churn.py` is python file consisting of code for creating a basic Dashboard which displays interacive Data Visualizations using Dash library.<br>
4. `assets` is a folder consisting of css templates used in the creation of Dashboard. Dash library requires this folder for implementing CSS.<br>
